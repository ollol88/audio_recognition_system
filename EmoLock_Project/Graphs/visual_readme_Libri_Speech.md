Project:
We built this project for https://www.oto.ai/. We tested their latest technology Deeptone on a
large open database (http://www.openslr.org/12) . We want to have an idea of the accuracy of their
model in predicting speakers identity and their emotions.

Results:
libri_speech_2_speakers.png and libri_speech_multiple_speakers.png show the clusters we created
with their model for 2 and multiple speakers. We use TSNE in 2 dimensions for the representation.
